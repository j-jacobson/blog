<h2 style="text-align: center;">Upgrading the iPod Classic 4th Generation Grayscale Memory to a 64GB microSD Card</h2>
<p>Jonathan Jacobson<br/>03.01.18</p>
<hr />
<p>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It's common to see memory upgrades for iPod classics, and there are a multitude of guides online (that are probably better than this one), but I figured I would write this one down to catalog what exactly I've done to my iPod.<br /><br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The iPod 4G comes stock with either a 20GB or 40GB IDE 1.8" hard drive inside. Many people who had one back in the day will remember the spinning and humming as an integral part of the nostalgia of iPods like these. However, hard drives are slow, loud, and prone to damage from drops and sudden movement. They are also very heavy, and the one that came in my iPod only holds 20GB! I have 3,000 songs in my library, so this will just not do. (iPod Hard Drive)<br /><br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Luckily, there are adapters made for iPods like these, the most usable being the 40 pin IDE to CF card adapter. CF cards are solid state storage and quite light, so putting one inside the iPod would be perfect - except the fact that they cost much more than a normal SD card and are a bit rare to find nowadays since people don't really use them in digital cameras anymore (their original widespread use). To get around this, I found a CF card to SD card adapter for a few dollars on eBay and got myself a 64GB microSD card and adapter. I only put 64GB inside because the software on the iPod 4G can only handle less than 10,000 songs, any more and things will go wrong. This is a bit of a bummer because on the later iPods, I've seen people putting 1TB and more into each one! I would never need that much storage though so it is okay.<br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Opening the iPod is the tough part, but I open my iPod so much that it takes only a few seconds. You need to open it from the right side, and it opens like a book. Make sure to turn the iPod off and put the hold switch on beforehand. The headphone jack and hold-switch connector is on the top left corner of the iPod, you must be very careful that you do not rip it, it is an expensive replacement piece (relatively). If you do break it, don't worry you can find them on eBay, or just buy a broken iPod on eBay, it will probably cost about the same in all honesty. (broken headphone jack iPod picture)<br /><br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Once you're inside, remove the battery connector from the motherboard, but be careful not to bend the motherboard too much, if bent at all it will make putting data to and from a computer incredibly difficult. The battery cutout on the motherboard is easily the worst thing about this iPod (the other is the weak headphone jack/hold switch connector). Be careful.<br /><br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After that, bend up the little metal piece near the top of the hard drive and pull it out (carefully). Don't put pressure on the hard drive face in any way if you want to salvage it/sell it on eBay, as this will damage it. Once it is removed, get the IDE to CF card ready and cut away the little piece of plastic that stops it from being inserted and put it in. You'll want to bend down the two leads that are sticking up as well, if you don't it will put pressure on the screen and you'll see an indentation on the front of the iPod. If this happens, just bend them down, the screen is very resilient it should be okay. Be sure to also put pin1 where it needs to go, there is usually a marker but you can see the picture if you are unsure. I donâ€™t think it would even fit in another way so don't worry too much.<br />

<br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Once this part is in, insert your microSD card into the CF card to SD card converter and plug the entire thing into the IDE to CF card adapter. Use tape to make sure nothing will shake inside once you close the case, the more tape the better. I also like to put a small piece of cardboard or paper in-between the adapter and the motherboard to make sure that there are no short circuits when things start to move around. I also do the same on the back casing, as it might short against that piece of metal as well. If you've added a battery there like in one of my other modifications, you wouldn't need that step.<br /><br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Once everything is inside and taped down, close the iPod and plug it into a computer (this is incredibly difficult to do on a Linux computer, it may be beneficial to dual-boot/virtual machine/have a friend with windows to do it for you.) If you have an Apple computer, this will also work.<br />

<br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The drive should show up in Windows, and if it isn't already you will want to format it to FAT32. This is a large drive and I know for a fact Windows 7 isn't capable of formatting a drive larger than 20 or 32 GB to FAT32, so you will need to use an external program. Most SD cards are already in FAT32 though so it should be okay. Once you do this the drive should show up in iTunes, where you follow the instructions to set up the iPod as a new device. At one point you'll need to plug your iPod into the wall, once you do this it should be okay!<br /><br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If using an Apple computer, you need to format the drive as a Journaled Drive and do pretty much the same thing.<br /><br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It should work now! Enjoy!<br />
